✋ Hand Sign Detection & Classification
This project is a real-time hand gesture recognition system using OpenCV and CVZone, designed to detect single and two-handed gestures, preprocess them, and classify them using a trained deep learning model.

📦 Features
🖐️ Detects both single-hand and two-hand signs

📷 Captures gesture data for training

🧠 Classifies live hand signs using a trained model

⚙️ Preprocessing includes cropping, resizing, aspect-ratio preserving scaling

🪟 Clean UI with instructions and gesture display

🎯 Example Use Cases

Gesture-based command interface

Educational tools for deaf-mute communication

Gesture dataset creation for training models

🧠 Future Improvements

Add support for dynamic signs (continuous gestures)

Train on more sign classes

Convert into a Streamlit or Tkinter app

Include confidence thresholds for prediction display
